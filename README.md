# KelpMaze

## Software
Unity v2018.3.5f1
Maya
FMOD 2.0

## Elevator pitch
Kelp Maze is based on the Spongebob Episode ["Club Spongebob"](https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x6nnw00). You play as the club ranger that must use his sword to cut through underwater kelp and flora, while using the conch to find your way to Spongebob, Patrick and Squidward before they starve. 

## Target Audience
Kelp Maze will be submitted into the [TV Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/tvgamejam) **before February 14, 4AM.** We will be measured on the following: 
1. Overall
2. Interpretation (how well you convert the TV episode into game form - which can be creative/abstract or a faithful adaptation)
3. Gameplay Innovation
4. Fun
5. Visuals (only rate based on art assets created during the jam, not art assets created before the jam)
6. Audio (only rate based on the audio created during the jam, not audio created before the jam)

## Platform
For this iteration, we will focus solely on PC. Other releases are possible in future.

## Genre
First person combat combined with exploration. Think Minecraft's exploration and procedural generation, except without crafting or mining elements and with an end goal (finding Spongebob).

## Player win state/goal
To find Spongebob and friends before they starve in a procedurally generated Kelp maze underwater. 

## Core mechanics

1. Walking/Traversal - Players must navigate a **procedurally generated underwater terrain**. 
2. Machete attack - Players must slash through kelp, coral, and other underwater flora to make their way. 
3. Lantern light - The area is dark, so the player carries a lantern to light the way
4. Switch items - Player presses Q to switch between sword and conch.
5. Conch GPS - Whenever the player pulls the string of the conch shell, the conch will let the player know whether they are close to finding Spongebob and friends. 

## Stretch goals

1. Timer system - To add extra tension, we are considering adding a time limit or countdown (in the form of days left or weeks left). When the timer runs out, a game over screen is called.
2. Food/hunger mechanic - We can randomly generate food cans around the map. As time passes, the player gets hungrier and must eat to proceed. 
3. Animated objects - If possible, we would like to animate the lantern, conch pull string, and slashed vegetation. 
4. Polish - Particle effects such as bubbles, underwater effects, moving aquatic life.

## Controls
1. WASD - Movement
2. Mouse move - Look around
3. Left Mouse Button - Attack/Use/Conch
4. Q - Swap between sword and conch


## Visual Style

We will employ a similar cartoony and friendly visual style as the TV show, with a slight darkness and terror (but still lighthearted) depicted in the episode. For copyright purposes, we cannot replicate Spongebob, Patrick, or Squidward's likeness too closely.
